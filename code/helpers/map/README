The http handler now includes an encoded version of the html file
containing the "map" data.

You can build your own version by
a. first creating an executable of the small program here
   g++ -o converter mapConverter.cpp
b. executing ./converter qt-map.html converted_map.cpp

The converted map will be included in the http handler
